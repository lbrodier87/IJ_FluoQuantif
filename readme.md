# IJ_FluoQuantif #

An ImageJ plugin written in java, with NetBeans project included. 
The plugin is used to quantify fluorescence in multiple channels at spindles poles. 
Spindles poles are identified by masking one channel containing a spindle pole marker. 
The masked ROIs are used to quantify mean fluo value in desired channels.
